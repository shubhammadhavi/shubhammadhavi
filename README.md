## Featured Projects

### [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/shubhammadhavi/credit-card-fraud-detection)
- Trained **Random Forest** & **Logistic Regression** on **284k+ transactions** with severe class imbalance.  
- Applied **SMOTE**, improving fraud **recall ~25%**; evaluated with ROC/PR curves & threshold tuning.  
- Clear EDA and visualizations; reproducible scripts and metrics.

### [Restaurant Review Sentiment (LSTM)](https://github.com/shubhammadhavi/sentimentAnalysis)
- Built **LSTM** text classifier; achieved **~92% accuracy** vs SVM/Random Forest baselines.  
- Text pipeline with **TF-IDF + embeddings (Word2Vec/GloVe)**; robust preprocessing & evaluation.

### Market Data ETL + Backtesting (Internship)
- Python ETL for large financial datasets; **Spark** transformations and partitioned outputs (Parquet).  
- **Automated backtesting** framework; collaborated on ML models (scikit-learn/TensorFlow) for trend prediction.  
- Optimized SQL schemas/queries for high-frequency storage and analysis. *(Repo: sanitized demo forthcoming)*
